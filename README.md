# Leetcode

## Patterns

- [Back Tracking](./docs/backtracking.md)
  - **Usage**: generate all combinations, permuations, subsets
  - **Brief Explain**: Backtracking can be seen as an optimized way to brute force which is to evaluate every possibility. In backtracking you stop evaluating a possibility as soon it breaks some constraint provided in the problem.
