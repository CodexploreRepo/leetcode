## Data Structure

- [Tree](./docs/ds/tree.md)

## Algorithm

- [Dynamic Programming](./docs/algorithm/dynamic_programming.md)
- [Back Tracking](./docs/algorithm/backtracking.md)
  - **Usage**: generate all combinations, permuations, subsets
  - **Brief Explain**: Backtracking can be seen as an optimized way to brute force which is to evaluate every possibility. In backtracking you stop evaluating a possibility as soon it breaks some constraint provided in the problem.
